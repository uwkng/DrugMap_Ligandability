# DrugMap Ligandability Prediction

## Project Overview
This project explores the **ligandability** of molecular structures using the **DrugMap_Ligandability dataset**.  
By leveraging **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)**, we aim to predict which molecules are potentially relevant for drug discovery.  

This is a **student project** conducted by a team of four as part of an academic exploration into ML/DL applications in molecular analysis.

## Methods
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Feature visualization and dataset cleaning  
- **Feature Engineering:** Selection of key molecular descriptors  
- **Model Development:** Comparison of 4 ML models (Gradient Boosting Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Extra Trees Clasifier, LightGBM) and 1 DL model (TensorFlow/Keras)  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model performance with Randomized Search and Grid Search
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, ROC-AUC, and F1-Score
